        <h2>About Me </h2>
          <p> My name is Diana Rodon. I am an undergraduate student at the University of Miami studying Journalism and English Literature. Beginning in January 2015 I will be studying abroad at the University of Kent. My intentions to study in England reflect much about my personality. I am a lover of books and storytelling and the United Kingdom has such a rich history in Literature. While there I intend to travel as much as possible as it is a passion of mine. I have only been in Europe once but have traveled to a majority of the states here in the U.S. </p>
