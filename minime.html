    <p class="hide1">Snuffy,</p>
    <p class="hide2">Carolina,</p>
    <p class="hide3">Caro.</p>
    <p class="hide4">Her name changed as she aged, more mature to represent the lady she was becoming.</p>
    <p class="hide5">You didn’t even notice, your mini-me, was all grown-up.</p>
    <p class="hide6">This person was growing up to be just like <button class="1">you.</button></p>

    <p class="hide7">When she was at the sweet age of <mark class="white">five,</mark></p>
    <p class="hide8">you could pull up a photo of yourself at five years and be unable to tell the difference.</p>
    <p class="hide9">Spending time together amidst strangers, you could be mistaken for sisters.</p>
    <p class="hide10">Your baby cousin’s similarities were not only physical but in personality and mannerisms.</p>
    <p class="hide11">Snuffy wanted to be cuddled and loved; she was the most <button class="2">cariñosa</button> of children.</p>
    <p class="hide12">Just like <button class="3">you.</button></p>

    <p class="hide13">Carolina was shy and quiet.</p>
    <p class="hide14">Just like <button class="4">you.</button></p>

    <p class="hide15">Caro is intelligent beyond her years; a bookworm before a child should even be allowed to read a novel.</p>
    <p class="hide16">Just like <button class="5">you.</button></p>

    <p class="hide17">You thought it would stop eventually but the years continued to pass and she became more alike you every moment.</p>
    <p class="hide18">Maybe it was your own fault. She looks up to you, why wouldn’t she strive to be like you? It should be a beautiful thing, to watch someone you love grow into themselves, but it terrifies you. What if she makes your mistakes?</p>
    <p class="hide19">What if <button class="6">she doesn’t?</button></p>

    <p class="hide20">Her birthday last week was what brought this realization. <mark class="white">Twelve.</mark></p>
    <p class="hide21"><mark class="white">Twelve</mark> had its memorable moments for you. You spent an evening during a hurricane reading Harry Potter by flashlight. If Caro had been given that situation, she probably would have done the same.</p>
    <p class="hide22">That idea makes you smile.</p>
    <p class="hide23">By <mark class="white">twelve,</mark> you’d worked past the bullying but were still supremely insecure. You hope she’s not insecure, like yourself she is individual and smart and loving.
    <p class="hide24">How could anyone not find that beautiful?</p>
    <p class="hide25">But when you see her face focus in the mirror and try to correct a beautiful imperfection, it brings tears to <button class="7">your eyes.</button></p>

    <p class="hide26">By <mark class="white">twelve,</mark> you had already been through the bulk of puberty; nearly at your designated “rest of your life” height and fully-fledged breasts.</p>
    <p class="hide27">And you were so envious of the other girls who were slower to puberty than you.</p>
    <p class="hide28">Why did you have to be the freak again?</p>
    <p class="hide29">The only one?</p>
    <p class="hide30">The only one to have their period for two years by <mark class="white">twelve.</mark></p>
    <p class="hide31">You knew that embarrassment as you attended a family gathering to celebrate an older cousin’s academic achievement on the first day of your <button class="8">first period.</button></p>

    <p class="hide32">You still recall the piercing words of your cousin when you told her why you sat at the table clutching your pelvis in agony:</p>
    <p class="hide33">“We shouldn’t be celebrating me! We should be celebrating you becoming a woman!”</p>
    <p class="hide34">Your face surely reddened and you left early cursing the torturous pains,</p>
    <p class="hide35">your head,</p>
    <p class="hide36">convulsing from tears,</p>
    <p class="hide37"><button class="9">on your father’s lap.</button></p>

    <p class="hide38">You anticipated Caro felt the same when she was gifted with hers. You were there on that first day too, her birthday whilst on vacation.</p>
    <p class="hide39">Talk about a birthday present.</p>
    <p class="hide40">Nobody told you, you found out a couple days later as you were babying your little cousins. Packing their suitcase for them you come across her underwear, stained as only the underwear of a child unbeknownst to this foreign concept could be.</p>
    <p class="hide41">You said nothing, simply packing the used clothing into their suitcase.</p>
    <p class="hide42">You knew better,</p>
    <p class="hide43">you could never let her have</p>
    <p class="hide44">the same <button class="10">mortifying experience.</button></p>

    <p class="hide45">Months later your aunt told you and your mom about Caro’s embarrassment over the matter:</p>
    <p class="hide46">“She hates to even talk about it.”</p>
    <p class="hide47">You knew you’d done the right thing when you heard she had reacted the same way as you.</p>
    <p class="hide48">And you weren’t shocked either</p>
    <p class="hide49">it was just another way <button class="11">you were alike.</button></p>

    <p class="hide50">Yet at <mark class="white">twelve</mark> there could be so much more going wrong than embarrassing moments.</p>
    <p class="hide51">Your friends at that age were never the best. You hadn’t found that right group so you stuck with what you could get.</p>
    <p class="hide52">You don’t know her friends and that worries you. You can’t assess if they’re good for her.</p>
    <p class="hide53">You’re her older cousin;</p>
    <p class="hide54">you’re allowed to be overprotective.</p>
    <p class="hide55">And she’s <button class="12">innocent.</button></p>

    <p class="hide56">You could be wrong, but if she’s anything like you</p>
    <p class="hide57">(and she is),</p>
    <p class="hide58">she won’t realize when she’s being used by someone for their own selfish purposes.</p>
    <p class="hide59">You can’t stand the idea of her being hurt by someone she cares about.</p>
    <p class="hide60">Your past innocence,</p>
    <p class="hide61">her present innocence,</p>
    <p class="hide62"><button class="13">travels further than that.</button></p>

    <p class="hide63">You want to tell her about your past romantic experiences and nonromantic ones.</p>
    <p class="hide64">“Men can be crude,” you would tell her. “You’re under no obligation to sit pretty while they harass you.”</p>
    <p class="hide65">You want to warn her not every one’s like that, many are not. There are a lot of wonderful people to share your affections with who deserve it and <button class="14">would return it.</button></p>

    <p class="hide66">You think she’s doing okay.</p>
    <p class="hide67">You think her future looks quite bright from where you’re standing.</p>
    <p class="hide68">But mostly,</p>
    <p class="hide69">if there’s any person she could be like</p>
    <p class="hide70">you’re pretty glad it’s you.</p>
