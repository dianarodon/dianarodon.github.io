        <h2>About Me </h2>
        <img src="FullSizeRender.jpg" class="small" alt="Rocky" />
          <p> My name is Diana Rodon. I am an undergraduate student at the University of Miami studying Journalism and English Literature. Beginning in January 2015 I will be studying abroad at the University of Kent. My intentions to study in England reflect much about my personality. I am a lover of books and storytelling and the United Kingdom has such a rich history in Literature. While there I intend to travel as much as possible as it is a passion of mine. I have only been in Europe once but have traveled to a majority of the states here in the U.S. </p>
          <p> My love of story telling and books has pervaded all aspects of my life. My dream is to one day publish a novel of my own, but the lifestyle of a starving artist is not exactly ideal. My studies at the University of Miami are preparing me for a career in a publishing house working in the editorial or design fields. </p>
