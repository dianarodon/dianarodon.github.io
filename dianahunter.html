      <h1>Diana, Hunter of Bus Drivers</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Her hands worn from tireless hours, she continues. She works as a conveyor belt of parts and pieces. She knows which parts go where, but not how they are used. But none of the women ask questions; they work their worn hands for tireless hours too, and chat while doing it. Gossip is a given in a <button class="1">maquiladora</button> filled with women. Isabel never partook, but the talk made the hours a little less boring, so she listened.</p>
	  <p>“Lourdes, you remember my neighbor Dolores?” Ximena asked.</p>
	  <p>“The one with the…?” Lourdes stopped what she was doing to gesture at her chest with both hands, as if she were holding a pair of enormous breasts.</p>
	  <p>“<button class="2">¡Si, si!</button>” Ximena giggled. “Well it seems not even her giant tits could get her a job here.”</p>
    <p>“<button class="3">¿Pero por que?</button>”</p>
	  <p>“She’s pregnant! It was just a matter of time before that girl got knocked up,” Ximena said shaking her head.</p>
	  <p>“<button class="4">Ay dios mio.</button> She’ll never get a job.”</p>
	  <p>“Well she shouldn’t have gone and gotten herself pregnant.”</p>
	  <p>“Ximena, she’s married!” Lourdes replied.</p>
	  <p>“Doesn’t mean she has the money to feed a baby. But nothing can be done now,” Ximena said. “How is your sister Isabel?”</p>
	  <p>Isabel was startled. She was not often spoken to in the <button class="5">maquiladora</button>.</p>
	  <p>“She is fine. Still working at the <button class="6">maquiladora</button> on the border,” she said, lying.</p>
	  <p>“Not pregnant?” Ximena joked.</p>
	  <p>“No.”</p>
	  <p>“Good, Marielena was always a sweet girl,” Ximena said. “Much like you.”</p>
	  <p>Isabel smiled softly in reply, returning to setting her pieces together.</p>
	  <p>“Don’t you get pregnant, either!” Ximena said.</p>
    <p>“¡Ximena!” Lourdes exclaimed in embarrassment.</p>
    <p>At the end of the work shift, everyone rushed out of the <button class="7">maquiladora.</button> Women split into groups to catch the right bus home, herding together for protection. Isabel joins her usual group for the bus traveling East and waits.</p>
	  <p>Isabel can hear Ximena telling another woman about her neighbor Dolores nearby. Lourdes approached her.</p>
    <p>“She never stops talking, does she?” Lourdes said glancing at Ximena, now roaring with laughter.</p>
    <p>“She has something to say.” Isabel smiled softly.</p>
	  <p>“Some of the girls think it’s because she is quiet in public like the rest of us, but also at home,” Lourdes whispered. “Her husband is not a very nice man.”</p>
    <p>“Poor Ximena,” Isabel replied.</p>
	  <p>“I heard that her husband sells guns illegally to—” Lourdes silenced at the approaching screech of the bus and reached into her purse.</p>
    <p>Every woman, including Dolores was now silent, clutching pens with the point facing outward. Their facial expressions hardened too, eyes fierce and stern as they boarded the bus with pens only ever so slightly visible to the men on board. They never looked a man in the eye, not even the bus driver as they paid their fare. They never looked down; they had to keep their heads held high.</p>
    <p>Isabel boarded in the same fashion as every woman before her, having been taught well by her mother. She hoped she could fool those around her to think she was tough, despite her small figure.</p>
    <p>“Smile, <button class="8">linda</button>,” a man said as Isabel walked to the back of the bus.</p>
    <p>She paid him no attention, never looking him in the eye. Her face was stern as she held her head high.</p>
	  <p>“<button class="9">Linda</button>, you shouldn’t be working in a <button class="10">maquiladora</button>. You should be a wife,” he said.</p>
	  <p>Again, Isabel ignored him but she was nervous. She didn’t know if she could keep this guise.</p>
	  <p>“Look at you, your dress too small. Let me take care of you,” he continued, smiling through blackened teeth.</p>
	  <p>Isabel’s lip quivered and she finally wavered. Her head turned down, slightly facing the streets outside the window. Lourdes next to her stayed stern but made a motion to hold her hand, as firmly as she held her head.</p>
    <p>The man smiled, this time showing off his gleaming silver tooth, as though he had just won the battle. Isabel’s eyes were focused on what was outside the parameters of the bus.</p>
    <p>She could see couples and friends walking the streets of Ciudad Juarez in merriment. The men on street corners played their guitars for a few pesos. No one glanced at the buses traveling by except for the women, who nodded with acknowledgment at the known dangers of boarding a bus in Mexico as a woman. Many of the women made eye contact with Isabel with concerned eyes, offering a prayer with a sign of the cross made over their bodies.</p>
    <p>The man made a motion to stand. Lourdes gripped Isabel’s hand harder, thinking the man would approach them. He leaned over, but kept his distance.</p>
    <p>“See you next time, <button class="11">linda</button>.” He turned around and boarded off.</p>
    <p>Isabel’s relief was not visible beneath her shaking. She removed her hand from Lourdes’s grasp to smooth out the skirt of her dress. She pulled at her sleeves, which she knew were too tight for her, but there was nothing she could do about it. When and if she had the money, it went to food and essentials.</p>
	  <p>After a quick glance at Lourdes’s stoic facial features, Isabel composed herself for the rest of the ride home. When she reached her street, she bypassed Lourdes with a quick grip on the shoulder to thank her for her comfort.</p>
	  <p>“See you next time, <button class="12">chica</button>,” says the bus driver with a wink.</p>
    <p>His hands linger away from the wheel, in wait for Isabel to pass him by. She attempts to quicken her pace but it doesn’t help. His hand reaches for her back, grabbing her ass with rough hands. He pushes his hand further, reaching underneath her short skirt, searching for something more to feel.</p>
	  <p>Isabel tries to pull away, to get off the bus, but he holds tighter. She remembers the object in her hand and slams it hard into his arm, producing a loud yelp from the bus driver as he held his now injured arm to him.</p>
	  <p>“<button class="13">¡Puta!</button>” he yelled as she ran off the bus. He hit the gas abruptly, bus doors still ajar.</p>
	  <p>Isabel stood on the side of the road, the bottom of her dress crinkled. As she smoothed it out she attempted to look stern for the rest of her journey, wishing she had another pen on her.</p>

	  <p>Isabel’s hand wrapped tightly around the knocker she was never able to reach in her childhood. Three consecutive knocks had her mother in a fury to hide, not very well as every scuff and shuffle could be heard from outside.</p>
	  <p>“<button class="14">¿Quien es?</button>” She could hear her mother yell from inside.</p>
	  <p>“¡Isabel!”</p>
	  <p>Her mother peeked an eye between the front window’s blinds, making sure it was her daughter. She threw the door open in confirmation.</p>
	  <p>“Why don’t you call? You need to call.” She motioned her inside.</p>
	  <p>“Sorry, mama. I just didn’t want to be alone.” She sat down on the rocking chair from which her father used to read to her. Her fingers grazed nicks she had made in the chair’s arm when she gnawed on it, trying to loose her first baby teeth.</p>
	  <p>“What happened, <button class="15">mi vida?</button>” her mother said from the kitchen. Isabel could see her placing the cafetera on the stove, preparing coffee as she always did when guests were over.</p>
	  <p>“The men…” It was all Isabel had to say for her mother to understand.</p>
	  <p>“<button class="16">Si…</button>” she began to reply. Her gaze shifted from Isabel’s pained face to the photo of her daughters on the wall. Isabel’s eyes followed.</p>
	  <p>“Have the police come back with anything?” Her voice was strained.</p>
	  <p>“No, the incompetent fools.” Isabel’s mother gripped the cafetera in anger. She quickly removed her hand, wincing. Isabel was at her mother’s side in moments, grabbing a towel and running it under the cold tap before applying it to her mother’s burned hand like a compress.</p>
    <p>“<button class="17">Esta bien, esta bien, chica.</button>” She moved Isabel’s hands away to continue. She poured their coffees and led the way back into the main room.</p>
    <p>They sat in silence, slowly sipping their coffees. The room was warm and the coffee emphasized that heat. A fan in the corner did nothing to relieve the heating tension. When her mother excused herself to bed, Isabel was left to her own accord though remained in the room that represented her family far too accurately. On every wall were photos of family or icons; crosses begged forgiveness to God for the many years of skipped services. Her mother was very concerned about entering heaven but would rather spend her Sundays cooking. She gazed on her favorite photo from her childhood; her father, Marielena, and herself snapped in front of the Diana statue in Mexico City. Her father always told them about the significance and strength of Diana, the huntress. He wanted them to be as strong as her, and as chaste. These days, Isabel wished she were as strong as Diana.</p>
	  <p>It was too late to go home now so she slept in Marielena’s bed. On the nightstand were Marielena’s collection of worry dolls. One stood out to her as she picked them up, she never noticed how alike her sister this one looked. She placed the Marielena worry doll under her pillow and wished with eyes tightly shut. Tears ran down her red cheeks.</p>
	  <p>Isabel knew what had happened. There could only be no other explanation. Women went missing in Ciudad Juarez for one reason only.</p>
    <p>Isabel woke before her mother and got ready to sneak away quietly. She went through Marielena’s drawers looking for fresh clothes, choosing a plain t-shirt and pants. Slipping her worn shoes on, she entered the main room and removed the photo in Mexico City off the wall and placed it in her purse. She had no plans to go to work today. She did not take a bus either—she would avoid that fate.</p>
	  <p>When she reached her house, her plan had been formed. She flipped open her address book and called Ximena’s home phone number.</p>
	  <p>“Who is this?” a man’s voice answered.</p>
	  <p>“My name is Isabel. I work with your wife, Ximena.”</p>
	  <p>“What did she do?” he said. Isabel could hear him slam something in the background.</p>
	  <p>“Uh, nothing. I wanted to speak with you.”</p>
    <p>“What about?”</p>
	  <p>“I want to buy a gun.” There was a long pause before he spoke again.</p>
	  <p>“Come to the house between 12 and 1 today. Do you have the address?”</p>
    <p>“Yes, I have it.”</p>
	  <p>She left Ximena and her husband’s house with a small pistol and several pens in her bag. She wasn’t taking the bus today for transport, so she walked to the nearest market and went straight for the hair dye section. Her eyes fell on a box for “Platinum Blondeshell” hair, with a beautiful blonde, likely American, woman on the front. It was easy to steal in Mexico, no clerk wants to be on the other end of a gun. Isabel had never done it—until now. She pushed the box of dye to the bottom of her purse and walked out nonchalantly.</p>
	  <p>Before the day’s end, Isabel had become Diana. Her hair fell down her back roughly—no longer soft; it felt and looked like straw. Her resolve strong, she felt equipped to protect, to right what had been wronged.</p>
	  <p>She waited at the bus stop for the next one to come. There were other women waiting, equipped with their simple weapons. When the bus finally arrived, she let the others go in before her. She began to climb the steps, stopping at the second one and waiting.</p>
    <p>“<button class="18">¡Andale, chica!</button>” the driver yelled at her.</p>
	  <p>In a matter of seconds, Isabel pulled out the pistol and shot him in the head, the heart, and the hand. She fled. Isabel stuffed the gun into her purse looking for the next bus stop further up the street.</p>
    <p>For the next couple of days, she continued to seek retribution. Shooting the bus drivers in the same three places each time: the head, heart, and hand.</p>
    <p>Sometimes Isabel recognized a woman on the bus, someone she knew from the maquiladora. She wondered if they recognized her, but no one ever said anything. No on ever turned her in although word had been spreading in Ciudad Juarez about this mystery woman.</p>
    <p>Once as she was about to leave, a woman called out.</p>
    <p>“Who are you?”</p>
	  <p>Isabel stopped and smiled. “I am Diana, the hunter of bus drivers.”</p>

    <p>Everyone in Ciudad Juarez had heard of Diana’s hunting. Word of her had reached the ears of the police; they cared about the crimes committed by women not men. Investigations were underway to find this Diana so Isabel decided to end this persona. She shaved her head with her father’s old razor, disposed of the gun, and returned to work at the maquiladora.</p>
    <p>She met Lourdes at the bus stop before work.</p>
    <p>“Hi, Isabel,” Lourdes said smiling.</p>
    <p>“Good to see you!” Isabel embraced her.</p>
    <p>They shared a look and both knowing. Lourdes smiled softly and mouthed “thanks.”</p>
    <p>When the bus arrived, Isabel held her pen like the others. Taking the first step up, she was stopped by the bus driver.</p>
    <p>“Why is your hair like that?” he asked.</p>
    <p>“I… Disrespected my husband… This was my punishment,” she said, running a hand over the hair she had left.</p>
    <p>“Are you Diana…?” he asked hesitantly.</p>
    <p>“No, why? Are you afraid?”</p>
