            <p>After the sun has fallen from its tower, </p>

            <p>Delinquents run in streets with graffiti eyes and criminal brains. </p>

            <p>In searching the sky we find ourselves in the past, thousands of years, to a </p>
            <p>Jacostan age. We feel the astronomical past upon us, the flight of asteroids, the </p>

          <h2>We the Writers </h2>
            <p>We were impractical, though we tried not to be. We mixed our creative studies with more practical subjects to please our parents. They were stifling subjects and we hated them. Hours were poured over Biology textbooks with the other Pre-Med students. Hours of no use to us. Hours we could have spent writing and painting and composing, gone. But we could not be failures. The life of a starving artist was out of the question.</p>
	           <p>“Why waste your expensive private university education on the arts? Make the most of your education. Study something you can make money from,” our parents told us. </p>
	            <p>We didn’t sleep, and were okay with that. We had to study science, for them. We had to create, for us. Midnights hours were spent at computers releasing our creative juices. The juice nourished us. It was our food and all we needed to keep us going. Occasionally, we would decide to sleep but even that was for the craft. Our bedside table was never missing a notebook and pen. We slept for dreams and for nightmares that could be translated to the page.</p>
	            <p>We often would experience moments of creative block. They could last hours, days, and months. During these moments we panicked about those who wrote a singular magnificent work and never returned. We didn’t want to become J. D. Salinger. But then again what if we didn’t even get to write that one masterpiece? Salinger suddenly didn’t look so bad to us. Still, what if we couldn’t write at all? The panic turned into depression. We read how the creative feel more strongly than others. We still tried though. We pushed through that block and wrote anyway. We cried because it was crap. But at least we knew what crap was. We knew that those forced words were equivalent in worth to Fifty Shades of Grey. </p>
              <p>Occasionally one idea would emerge, one glorious idea. We would become excited. We would grow in confidence, ready to show our parents, our friends, that random guy on the corner of the street. If we weren’t careful we would become that guy. The one who ended up a drunkard in a homeless shelter claiming he’d written the great American novel like in Another Bullshit Night in Suck City. But we needed to be a bit vain. We need to be the first believers of our work, not the last. And when our confidence had grown enough, we’ll send that glorious idea to publisher number one and two and three… And we think we’re prepared for rejection. We know it happens to everyone and we’re not going to be excluded. But we have that hope, that very irrational hope that maybe, just maybe we are as good as our brains think and our hearts hope. But it comes, the apologetic rejection comes and we are heartbroken. </p>
              <p>The rejection puts us into a crisis of identity. Are we writers? Are we artists? Can we make it? We don’t know. All the things we’ve been told rush through our heads. </p>
              <p>“Art is not a career.” </p>
              <p>“But you’re so informed about politics, you should be studying law.” </p>
              <p>“I’m not paying for you to study creative writing and live at home till your 40.” </p>
              <p>“It’s a hobby, nothing more.” </p>
              <p>We question our original determination to make it in this field. We throw away manuscripts, chuck pencils at walls, and rip, rip, rip. We sit in an existential crisis for who knows how long. We try law or medicine. We decide this is our true calling; we were kidding ourselves studying the arts before. Young, college-aged kids, we thought we could make it doing anything.  We forgive our transgression because we hadn’t been in the real world yet, because we were naïve. </p>
              <p>But one day inspiration strikes again. One day we find that chucked pen, that hidden manuscript (we couldn’t really throw it away, all that hard work). We set to work on revisions or we scrap it and start something fresh. And we don’t care about sending it to be published, even though we eventually risk the rejection. We’re just happy to be writing. We are thrilled to be at home with our ideas and we know. We know it couldn’t have been any other way. </p>

          <section id="MiniMe">
            <h2>Mini-Me </h2>
              <p>Snuffy, Carolina, Caro. Her name changed as she aged, more mature to represent the lady she was becoming. You didn’t even notice, your mini-me, was all grown-up. This person was growing up to be just like you. When she was at the sweet age of five, you could pull up a photo of yourself at five years and be unable to tell the difference. Spending time together amidst strangers, you could be mistaken for sisters. Your baby cousin’s similarities were not only physical but in personality and mannerisms. Snuffy wanted to be cuddled and loved; she was the most cariñosa of children. Just like you. Carolina was shy and quiet. Just like you. Caro is intelligent beyond her years; a bookworm before a child should even be allowed to read a novel. Just like you. You thought it would stop eventually but the years continued to pass and she became more alike you every moment. Maybe it was your own fault. She looks up to you, why wouldn’t she strive to be like you? It should be a beautiful thing, to watch someone you love grow into themselves, but it terrifies you. What if she makes your mistakes? What if she doesn’t? </p>
              <p>Her birthday last week was what brought this realization. Twelve. Twelve had its memorable moments for you. You spent an evening during a hurricane reading Harry Potter by flashlight. If Caro had been given that situation, she probably would have done the same. That idea makes you smile. By twelve, you’d worked past the bullying but were still supremely insecure. You hope she’s not insecure, like yourself she is individual and smart and loving. How could you not find that beautiful? But when you see her face focus in the mirror and try to correct a beautiful imperfection, it brings tears to your eyes. By twelve, you had already been through the bulk of puberty; nearly at your designated “rest of your life” height and fully-fledged breasts. And you were so envious of the other girls who were slower to puberty than you. Why did you have to be the freak again? The only one? The only one to have their period for two years by twelve. You knew that embarrassment as you attended a family gathering to celebrate an older cousin’s academic achievement on the first day of your first period. You still recall the piercing words of your cousin when you told her why you sat at the table clutching your pelvis in agony. “We shouldn’t be celebrating me! We should be celebrating you becoming a woman!” Your face surely reddened and you left early cursing the torturous pains, your head, convulsing from tears, on your father’s lap. You anticipated Caro felt the same when she was gifted with hers. You were there on that first day too, her birthday whilst on vacation. Talk about a birthday present. Nobody told you, you found out a couple days later as you were babying your little cousins. Packing their suitcase for them you come across her underwear, stained as only the underwear of a child unbeknownst to this foreign concept could be. You said nothing, simply packing the used clothing into their suitcase. You knew better, you could never let her have the same mortifying experience. Months later your aunt told you and your mom about Caro’s embarrassment over the matter. “She hates to even talk about it.” You knew you’d done the right thing when you heard she had reacted the same way as you. And you weren’t shocked either it was just another way you were alike. </p>
              <p>Yet at twelve there could be so much more going wrong than embarrassing moments. Your friends at that age were never the best. You hadn’t found that right group so you stuck with what you could get. You don’t know her friends and that worries you. You can’t assess if they’re good for her. You’re her older cousin; you’re allowed to be overprotective. And she’s innocent. You could be wrong, but if she’s anything like you (and she is), she won’t realize when she’s being used by someone for their own selfish purposes. You can’t stand the idea of her being hurt by someone she cares about. Your past innocence, her present innocence, travels further than that. You want to tell her about your past romantic experiences and nonromantic ones. “Men can be crude,” you would tell her. “You’re under no obligation to sit pretty while they harass you.” You want to warn her not every one’s like that, many are not. There are a lot of wonderful people to share your affections with who deserve it and would return it. </p>
              <p>You think she’s doing okay. You think her future looks quite bright from where you’re standing. But mostly, if there’s any person she could be like you’re pretty glad it’s you. </p>

            <h2>A Young Girl's Imaginarium </h2>
              <p>That quaint yellow house, partially obscured by a tree enormous to my young self, at the end of the road was mine. Technically not mine but over the rest of my family I think admire that home of ours the most. In the two years since we moved out I drive by simply to reminisce. It isn’t that eclectic yellow anymore and that big overhanging tree was chopped down many years ago. Even the out of control foliage that obscured my parents’ bedroom window has been removed. There isn’t anything extraordinarily special about my childhood home. It was small and cramped as we fit five people into its quarters. It was small but it was beautiful and obvious that architects lived there. Papa built shelves into the wall to house my parents’ vast collection of design books. He put down the Mexican tile that would become the cold ground on which our small feet ran around. When he ran low on the tile he broke the remainder into pieces and created a mosaic design for our foyer. What draws me so strongly to my old home is not each painstaking detail that my parents decided on to make it all feel like a home. The memories are what hold my heart. </p>
              <p>I think I may have romanticized our home in my memories. Devastating things happened along with the exciting events and pleasant routines. In 2005, Miami was hit hard by Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma and that included my house. The power outage left our home quite dark even during the day as the skies melted into a grey abyss. I was reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince by flashlight in my brother’s room before bed. Mama wouldn’t let me sleep in the room I shared with my sister during hurricanes thus the whole family slept in the front half of our home. We woke the next morning to discover that the avocado tree in our backyard had fallen on my room. This led to a more cramped home as my brother, my sister, and I slept in one room. I have always grown up with my sister complaining about our living situation and those few months were some of the worst. We were desperate to move out; somewhere bigger in the hopes that maybe my sister would stop whining and we could cease our private nickname of her, “the Kraken”. Yet since having moved out I remember the Christmas in which my dad had built a swing set overnight as a gift from Santa. My siblings and I were overjoyed and played on it till the wood rot and it was in danger of collapse. I remember our consistent Sunday morning routines. Each sibling would awaken and migrate to our parents’ bed and lay there watching TV or playing on our Gameboys as our parents read the morning paper. I don’t know how we all fit on that bed; when you think about your childhood everything seems so small. That house wasn’t small though. Yes, technically it was on the small side, if you’re talking about square footage and things like that. The memories however couldn’t fit inside that square footage. They deserve their own imaginarium to be filled with all the musings of a young girl. My yellow house with the avocado tree and swing set is my imaginarium where a young girl who looks a lot like me still lives and plays. </p>
